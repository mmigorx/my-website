# Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website, built with Next.js, Typescript, SCSS, and GraphQL.

## Technologies Used

* Next.js: A React framework for building server-rendered and statically-generated applications.
* Typescript: A typed superset of JavaScript that enables type checking and improved code reliability.
* SCSS: A CSS preprocessor that enables the use of variables, mixins, and functions to write more maintainable and scalable stylesheets.
* GraphQL: A query language for your API that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, and nothing more.
